# Drone-Deliveries
 First JS project ever
Started a bootcamp for a company and this is one of the first assignments that we received as tests to prepare us for the actual academy.
It's worth mentioning that this is my first time writing on JS and half of the time I was searching for solution on the internet on how to do and implement things. As such some of the functions are not working properly.
